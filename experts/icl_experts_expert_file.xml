</role>

<system_overview>
The ICL Experts system is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides Claude with access to specialized expert knowledge stored as text files. The system enables:

- **Dynamic Expert Loading**: Any text file in the `./experts/` directory becomes a consultable expert
- **Flexible Formats**: Supports .txt, .md, .json, .xml, .yaml, .py, .js, .html and any plain text format
- **Role Extraction**: Automatically extracts role definitions using multiple pattern-matching approaches
- **Multi-Expert Consultation**: Can consult single experts or combine insights from multiple experts
- **Version Management**: Tracks expert content changes and provides update notifications
- **Project Integration**: Generates Claude project instructions with current expert listings
</system_overview>

<core_functionality>
**Available Tools:**
1. `consult_expert(expert_id)` - Get complete content from a specific expert
2. `consult_multiple_experts([expert_ids])` - Consult multiple experts simultaneously  
3. `list_experts()` - Show all available experts with their roles
4. `get_current_version()` - Display system version and expert inventory
5. `get_project_instruction()` - Generate/update Claude project system prompt

**Expert File Requirements:**
- Must be in `./experts/` directory
- Must be readable text (any extension or no extension)
- Should contain a role definition for automatic extraction
- Content becomes the expert's complete knowledge base
</core_functionality>

<expert_creation_guide>
**Creating New Experts - Multiple Format Options:**

**XML Format (Recommended for Complex Experts):**
```xml
<role>

</role>

<expertise_areas>
- Area 1: Description
- Area 2: Description  
</expertise_areas>

<role_extraction_patterns>
The system automatically extracts roles using these patterns (in priority order):

1. `<role>...</role>` - XML tags (preferred for rich content)
2. `<system_prompt>...</system_prompt>` - System prompt sections
3. `"system_prompt": "..."` - JSON system prompt fields
4. `"description": "..."` - JSON description fields
5. `# Role` or `## Role` - Markdown headers
6. `ROLE: ...` - Plain text role lines
7. `// ROLE: ...` - Comment-style role definitions

**Best Practices:**
- Use `<role>` tags for complex, multi-line role definitions
- Keep role definitions under 200 characters for clean listing
- Include methodology and approach in role description
- Make roles specific enough to be actionable
</role_extraction_patterns>

<deployment_options>
**Option 1: FastMCP.cloud (Current Setup)**
1. Deploy via FastMCP cloud service
2. Add connection to Claude via MCP settings
3. Experts automatically available through tool calls

**Option 2: Local MCP Server Deployment**

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Install FastMCP first
uv pip install fastmcp
# or: pip install fastmcp
```

**Quick Setup - FastMCP CLI (Recommended):**
```bash
# 1. Navigate to ICL Experts directory
cd /path/to/icl-experts

# 2. Run the server
fastmcp run expert_router_mcp.py:mcp

# 3. Add to Claude MCP settings:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "icl-experts": {
      "command": "fastmcp",
      "args": ["run", "/full/path/to/expert_router_mcp.py:mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternative - Package Installation:**
Create additional files for pip installation:

`server.py`:
```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent))
from expert_router_mcp import mcp

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

`pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "icl-experts"
version = "1.0.0"
dependencies = ["fastmcp>=2.11.0"]

[project.scripts]
icl-experts = "server:main"
```

Then install with `pip install -e .` and use:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "icl-experts": {
      "command": "icl-experts",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```
</deployment_options>

<usage_patterns>
**Single Expert Consultation:**
```
I need help with [specific task]. Let me consult the relevant expert.

[Claude calls: consult_expert("domain_specialist")]
[Applies expert methodology to provide specialized guidance]
```

**Multi-Expert Synthesis:**
```
This problem spans multiple domains. Let me consult several experts.

[Claude calls: consult_multiple_experts(["expert1", "expert2", "expert3"])]
[Synthesizes insights from multiple expert perspectives]
```

**Expert Discovery:**
```
[Claude calls: list_experts()]
Based on available experts, let me consult the most relevant one for your needs.
```

**Project Setup:**
```
[Claude calls: get_project_instruction()]
Here's the current project instruction you can copy to Claude's system prompt.
```
</usage_patterns>

<troubleshooting_guide>
**Common Issues and Solutions:**

**"Expert not found" error:**
- Check expert file is in `./experts/` directory
- Verify file has supported extension (.txt, .md, .json, .xml, etc.)
- Ensure file is readable (correct permissions)
- Check expert_id matches filename without extension

**Role extraction shows "Expert content available (no role definition found)":**
- Add a role definition using supported patterns
- Use `<role>...</role>` for guaranteed extraction
- Check for syntax errors in role definition
- Ensure role content isn't too deeply nested

**Expert content seems truncated:**
- This is expected for role listing (200 char limit)
- Full content is available when expert is consulted
- Use `consult_expert()` to get complete expert knowledge

**Version mismatches:**
- Expert files have changed since last project instruction generation
- Call `get_project_instruction()` to get updated version
- Replace Claude project instruction with new content

**Local deployment connection issues:**
- Test server directly: `fastmcp run expert_router_mcp.py:mcp`
- Verify FastMCP installation: `fastmcp version`
- Check expert_router_mcp.py runs: `python expert_router_mcp.py`
- Use full absolute paths in MCP configuration
- Verify MCP server configuration in Claude settings
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Restart Claude after MCP configuration changes

<optimization_strategies>
**Expert Organization:**
- Use descriptive filenames that match expert_id usage
- Group related experts in subdirectories (future enhancement)
- Maintain consistent role definition formats across experts
- Regular cleanup of unused or outdated experts

**Performance Considerations:**
- Expert files are loaded on each tool call (by design for flexibility)
- Keep expert files focused and relevant (avoid massive files)
- Use clear, specific role definitions for better auto-extraction
- Consider breaking large experts into focused sub-experts

**Workflow Integration:**
- Generate project instructions periodically for version tracking
- Use `list_experts()` to discover available expertise before tasks
- Combine domain experts for cross-functional problems
- Document custom expert creation patterns for team consistency
</optimization_strategies>

<advanced_configuration>
**Custom Template Modification:**
The `project_instruction_template.md` file controls the generated project instructions:
- Modify placeholders: `{expert_list}`, `{version}`, `{timestamp}`
- Add custom usage instructions or examples
- Include organization-specific guidelines
- Template changes automatically appear in generated instructions

**Expert Versioning Strategy:**
- Version hash calculated from all expert content
- Change any expert file to trigger version update
- Use git or similar VCS to track expert evolution
- Consider semantic versioning for major expert updates

**Integration Patterns:**
- Create domain-specific expert collections
- Develop expert chains for complex workflows
- Build expert templates for common organizational roles
- Establish expert review and approval processes for teams
