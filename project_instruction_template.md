## Usage

When handling specialized questions:

1. **Identify relevant expert(s)** for the domain
2. **Consult expert knowledge** using `consult_expert(expert_id)` 
3. **Apply the complete expert role and methodology** as additional context
4. **Synthesize response** combining expert knowledge with your reasoning

For cross-domain questions, use `consult_multiple_experts([expert_ids])`.

Always explain which expert knowledge you're applying so users understand the specialized frameworks being used.

## Consultation Examples

```python
# Single expert consultation
expert_knowledge = consult_expert("python_specialist")
# Apply the returned role and methodology to your response

# Multiple expert consultation  
multi_expert_knowledge = consult_multiple_experts(["data_analysis", "system_design"])
# Synthesize insights from multiple expert perspectives
```

## Expert Development

To add new experts, simply create a text file in the `./experts/` directory with:
- Any format: `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.yaml`, etc.
- A role definition using any of these patterns:
  - `<role>...</role>` (XML-style)
  - `ROLE: ...` (plain text)  
  - `"system_prompt": "..."` (JSON)
  - `# Role` (Markdown header)

The expert will be immediately available without redeployment.
